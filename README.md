## ![](1-following-level-curves/icon.png) Project 1: Following Level Curves

Graphs a level curve of a function (R2->R1) by choosing a starting point and iteratively moving along a line tangent to the curve (∇f(xn)⊥).

## Project 2: Basins of Attraction

## Visualizes how application of Newton's method to find the zeroes of a function (R2->R2) is affected by use of different starting points.

Project 3: Contour Curves

## An improved version of project 1; graphs a planar approximation of the solution set of f(x)=0 in many small rectangular areas.

## Project 4: Jacobi Algorithm

Analyzes runtime optimization of the Jacobi algorithm for solving the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix.
